The design solution using the Factory Method and Singleton design patterns to address the requirements specified above can be developed as the following code.
It employs the Factory Method and Singleton patterns to efficiently manage entity creation in a city simulation game. It abstracts entity behaviours through the Entity interface, with concrete classes representing different entity types. Factories, controlled by “SingletonFactoryProvider”, create instances based on specified types. This centralized approach ensures consistency and scalability. New entities can be added without altering the existing code. Overall, the design balances flexibility, efficiency, and centralized control, offering a robust solution for entity management in the game.
